Inform7 text adventure / interactive fiction version of a MUD area based on the battlefield from the Mahabharata. 
There is no real game or puzzles or story, but you can walk around and look at things. The main characters of the epic are here with some of their characteristic qualities, clothing, weapons, flags, or objects, and a few of the gods watch over the battlefield. It was originally written for Arcane Nites, a MERC/Diku Envy variant, in around 1998. The subtleties of the equipment stats are lost here. I may in future make this a playable game with some puzzles and more of a narrative.
