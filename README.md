Inform7 text adventure / interactive fiction version of a MUD area based on the battlefield from the bit of the Mahabharata where the Bhagavad Gita takes place - the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The Pandavas and their uncles and their cousins, the Dhritarastras, are in a terrible war. 

There is no real game or puzzles or story, but you can walk around and look at the characters and some room details. The main characters of the epic are here with some of their characteristic qualities, clothing, weapons, flags, or objects, and a few of the gods watch over the battlefield. To play it, download Inform7 (free) and then these files. 

This area was originally written for Arcane Nites, a MERC/Diku Envy variant, maybe around 1998, as a high level area, quite dangerous (especially the heavens and the gods). The subtleties of the equipment stats are lost here. I may in future make this a playable game with some puzzles and more of a narrative.
